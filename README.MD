# **üìöDirectory of countries Project**

Welcome to the directory of countries project! This project is a Java-based web application built using Spring Boot,
Hibernate, Swagger and other technologies to create a robust online bookstore.

## **üìù1. Introduction**

This project is a country directory that provides users with an endpoint to view country information. It is built 
using Java with a Spring Boot infrastructure using technologies such as Hibernate for database interaction, Swagger 
for API documentation. <br> With the start of program execution, all information from the resource: 
http://analityk1.com.ua:9111/api/reference/RiskCountries will be added to the application database. After that, when 
the user sends a request to receive information about the country, the server will check whether there is such a 
country in the database, if so, then you will receive a JSON response with the data. Or NOT_FOUND, if there is no 
country with such data in the database.
